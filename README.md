# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The purpose DriverPass project was to build a web application for customers wishing to take driving instruction classes.  The customers were able to reserve times with instructors and take practice exams online.  The client was DriverPass and they wanted to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road
training to better prepare them for driving tests.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think that I described the system requirements well.  I did this based on real-world experience and following the design would lead to a very stable, scalable, and cheap solution.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to improve the user interface section of the business requirements document.  I did not really go into detail about it and that is how it could be improved.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's need and implemented them into my system design by creating various diagrams to understand exactly what the client wanted.  This is important because without listening to the client, the business need for the application will not be addressed and the application will be useless.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software in a very logical way.  I think that the various diagrams I learned how to use in this class will help the logical flow of my process when designing applications in the future.
